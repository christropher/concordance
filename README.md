# concordance
Corcordance programs written in C# and Ruby. Bonus for both.

## Challenge:
* Given an arbitrary text document written in English, write a program that will generate a concordance, i.e. an alphabetical list of all word occurrences, labeled with word frequencies. Bonus: label each word with the sentence numbers in which each occurrence appeared.

* For the C# Version, run via https://dotnetfiddle.net/4G8wTp or you could compile the cs file in Visual Studio.
* Ruby version coming.
